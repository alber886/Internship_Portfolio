    <h1>Internship Projects</h1>
        <p>
            When I first joined ASR I started working on reforming One Stop Student Services' forms and the way they are presented to the audience.
            I then moved on to the ASR's own page, FERPA content, and heuristic evaluations.

        <h2>One Stop Student Serivces: Forms</h2>

            <p>
                The original format used by One Stop was listing all the forms in different categories <strong>(Fig. 1)</strong>,
                and by clicking on a box, it would simply open the form with no explanation whatsoever. While the system had no technical problem itself, 
                and no accessinility issues regarding coding or alt text, it was still not satisfying user needs 
                because of how hard it was to decipher what each form entailed.
            </p>

            <p>To improve the quality, and assist the audience in finding the content they need and knowing how to use it, 
                new informational pages were created for each form.
            Content experts were in charge of creating the content for each informational page, which I then edited for readability and clarity,
                to lastly format it into Drupal and create the new pages.
            </p>

            <p>
                The process for this project, was quite straightforward. We had a large spreadsheet where all of the One Stop Form where listed, 
                and each one of them was linked to a document with the information from content experts. For most of the pages I built (100 total) 
                I did some brief proof reading and content editing, and then moved to Drupal.
                While I was supposed to have simple access to the forms just by linking the new pages to the previous content on the website, 
                for around 20% of the pages I created I had to reformat the forms, as they were originally linked in inaccessible ways. These forms would open as PDFs 
                in an acrobat page, which does not follow the Univeristy standards.
            </p>

            <p>
                These are some pages I've built where I had to do some more extensive editing, as the content given by experts had the guidelines on 
                the form itself, and the additional documents and/or information a student would need to submit the form were mixed together, rather than 
                listed in a logical order. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Lastly, some forms were retired and removed from the website because they were no longer up to date, or they were supposed to be used for 
                actions no longer performable.
