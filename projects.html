    <h1>Internship Projects</h1>
        <p>
            When I first joined ASR I started working on reforming One Stop Student Services' forms and the way they are presented to the audience.
            I then moved on to the ASR's own page, various accessibility reports, FERPA content, and heuristic evaluations.

        <h2>One Stop Student Serivces: Forms</h2>

            <p>
                The original format used by One Stop was listing all the forms in different categories <strong>(Fig. 1)</strong>,
                and by clicking on a box, it would simply open the form with no explanation whatsoever. While the system had no technical problem itself, 
                and no accessibility issues regarding coding or alt text, it was still not satisfying user needs 
                because of how hard it was to decipher what each form entailed.
            </p>

            <p>Because of the long lists of different forms, it can be hard for students and/or advisors to 
                find exactly what they need, and understand what they need to do in order to complete a desired task. 
                To improve the quality, and assist the audience in finding the content they need and knowing how to use it, 
                new informational pages were created for each form.
            Content experts were in charge of creating the content for each informational page, which I then edited for readability and clarity,
                to lastly format it into Drupal and create the new pages.
            </p>

            <p>
                The process for this project, was quite straightforward. We had a large spreadsheet where all of the One Stop Form where listed, 
                and each one of them was linked to a document with the information from content experts. For most of the pages I built (100 total) 
                I did some brief proof reading and content editing, and then moved to Drupal.
                While I was supposed to have simple access to the forms just by linking the new pages to the previous content on the website, 
                for around 20% of the pages I created I had to re-link the forms, as they were originally presented in inaccessible ways. These forms would open as PDFs 
                in an acrobat page, which does not follow the Univeristy standards. Instead, I had to download the forms, add the to our 
                shared drive where the other content was present, and lastly share them through google drive. Linking the documents in such a way follows
                the University's web guidelines, and it allows for additional accessibility.
            </p>

            <p>
                These are some pages I've built where I had to do some more extensive editing and re-writing of content. For example, some of the guidelines were only
                listed on the form itself, rather than in the content needed for the informational pages. Additionally, I separated instructions and lists of separate 
                documents needed for the forms in a more logical order, which allows users to be better prepared to complete the desired tasks.

            <p>
                The last step of this project for One Stop Student Services was retiring and removing certain forms. Forms that were no longer applicable to 
                user needs, such as financial forms from previous academic years, were removed from the site to avoid confusion and reduce user errors. 
                Other forms were removed simply because they did not belong to One Stop, but to other University offices, or because they were no longer needed 
                (such as forms specific to 2020's quarantine and lockdowns).
        
            </p>

            <p>
                I was able to complete this project by applying the skills I've been learning as a Technical Writing and Communication student, and learned more along the way.
                Editing language for clarity, and placing content in a strategic and logical order were the skills I had to put into practice the most
                as I worked on creating these new informational pages. To ensure that the audience would be satisfied and able to easily understand what the website is
                trying to convey, these skills are necessary, and I was able to see how I am capable of taking what I have learned into the classroom, and replicate it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Creating web pages also gave me a better understanding of how Drupal works, and how to use it most effectively. While I had used Drupal before in 
                a different job position, I had never been so extensively part of the creation process of templates and pages. This is yet another skill that I can 
                now master and use to prepare myself for future job opportunities as a Technical Writer.
