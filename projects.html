    <h1>Internship Projects</h1>
        <p>
            When I first joined ASR I started working on reforming One Stop Student Services' forms and the way they are presented to the audience.
            I then moved on to the ASR's own page, FERPA content, and heuristic evaluations.
        </p>

        <h2>One Stop Student Serivces: Forms</h2>

            <p>
                The original format used by One Stop was listing all the forms in different categories <strong>(Fig. 1)</strong>,
                and by clicking on a box, it would simply open the form with no explanation whatsoever. While the system had no technical problem itself, 
                and no accessinility issues regarding coding or alt text, it was still not satisfying user needs 
                because of how hard it was to decipher what each form entailed.
            </p>

            <p>To improve the quality, and assist the audience in finding the content they need and knowing how to use it, 
                new informational pages were created for each form.
            Content experts were in charge of creating the content for each informational page, which I then edited for readability and clarity,
                to lastly format it into Drupal and create the new pages.
