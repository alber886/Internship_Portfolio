        <h1> WRIT 3896: Internship in Technical Writing and Communication</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this Github repositoey and page is to showcase projects, skills, and personal growth gained through the UX & Content Strategy 
            Internship I was part of during the Fall Semester of 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the semester, I was enrolled in the course WRIT 3896: Internship in Technical Writing and Communication, in which I was able
            to take the time to reflect on my skills, and how the experience with the Academic Support Resources team introduced me to the Technical Writing
            career. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Part of this course is to deliver a final portfolio that includes an overview of the internship, a few project samples, 
            a map of the new skills I gained, a personal reflection, and lastly a written evaluation
            from my supervisor. 
        </p>

    <h2>Internship Overview: UX and Content Strategy</h2>
        <p>
           On September 11, 2025 I joined the UX and Content Strategy team of the Academic Support Resources (ASR) office at the University of Minnesota, as an intern.
            ASR deals with operations at the university related to student records, registration, financial aid, and student accounts. Different units that are part
            of ASR are:
            <ol>
                <li>Information Technology;</li>
                <li>Office of Classroom Management;</li>
                <li>Office of Student Finance;</li>
                <li>Office of the Registrar;</li>
                <li>One Stop Student Services;</li>
                <li>Operations and Strategic Initiatives:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where UX and Content Strategy operates.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>The Operations and Strategic Initiatives (OSI) group 
                is in charge of administrative support, training and security, communications, and user experience across all ASR 
            units. Per the
                <a href="https://asr.umn.edu/asr-units-and-teams/asr-operations-and-strategic-initiatives"
                    alt="website of Operations and Strategic Initiatives"> OSI Website</a>, the unit manages 19 websites, 21 online training courses, and 52 projects.
            </p>

        <h3>My position</h3>
            <p>
                As a UX and Content Strategy Intern, I worked with my supervisor Eric Anderson, the team's Technical Lead, and Associate Director Kate Sophia.
                While Eric was the main person assigning me tasks and giving me feedback, I completed a couple of projects upon Kate's request and supervising.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The main tasks I was assigned on a weekly basis included website content writing, editing, and design. These tasks were part of 
                projects led by my supervisor and included different people from multiple teams. I mainly focused on content for the One Stop Student Services unit,
                and overall ASR content, for a series of projects dedicated to improve accessibility and user experience of the sites.
                However, I also had the opportunity to work on bigger and personal projects, such as completing
                a redesign of a faulty webpage, participating in Usability Evaluations, and conducting a Heuristic Evaluation of website content based on user
                feedback, to then come up with a plan for next steps.
            </p>
    <h3>Timeframe and schedule</h3>
            <p>
                My internship started in November of 2025, and will continue into the spring semester until May of 2026. I work 11 hours a week, to balance my class
                schedule and my office job. On Mondays, I work remotely from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. and this is when I get to work on my projects the most, and have 
                team meetings. On Thursdays, I join the team in the office from 1:00 P.M. to 3:00 P.M. twice a month, and work remotely the rest of the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The days in which the team gets to be in the office, a lot of the time is spent catching up with each other, and I don't manage to get as much work done - 
                especially because I get to the office when others are having lunch, and they invite me to chat with them.
            </p>
